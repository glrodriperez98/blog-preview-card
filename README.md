## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Figtree)

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce key foundational concepts such as flexbox layout and hover/focus styling. I also practiced organizing content semantically and paid special attention to visual alignment and spacing.

#### A couple of snippets I’m proud of:

```css
.card {
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 1rem;
  box-shadow: 8px 8px 0px #000;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 1rem;
}
css
Copy
Edit
.title a:hover {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}
These snippets show how I used Flexbox and subtle hover styling to enhance both structure and interactivity.

Continued development
I'd like to continue improving my skills in responsive design and accessibility. For future versions of this project, I might explore how to make the card responsive across multiple screen sizes or include ARIA labels for better screen reader support.

Useful resources
CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide – Great for understanding Flexbox layout behavior.
