## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Figtree)

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce key foundational concepts such as flexbox layout and hover/focus styling. I also practiced organizing content semantically and paid special attention to visual alignment and spacing.

#### A couple of snippets Iâ€™m proud of:

```
css
.card {
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 1rem;
  box-shadow: 8px 8px 0px #000;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 1rem;
}
```
```
css
.title a:hover {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}
```
These snippets show how I used Flexbox and subtle hover styling to enhance both structure and interactivity. It took me some time to work out the specific shape for the box-shadow and that is what I am most proud of for this project.

### Continued development
I'd like to continue improving my skills in responsive design and accessibility. For future versions of this project, I might explore how to make the card responsive across multiple screen sizes or include ARIA labels for better screen reader support.
